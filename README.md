# nosql-social-network-api

## Description

This app is a social network which allows users to create thoughts and react to other peoples thoughts. Using Insomnia, a user can Get, Post, Put, and Delete data. 

Some challenges I had working on this was getting th eroutes to work properly. There are so many moving parts with the differet routes, controllers, and models that I really had to be diligent in making sure all the naming conventions etc. were consistent throughout.
